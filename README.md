# Contact Management Application

## Project Description

This is a **Contact Management Application** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application allows users to manage contacts by adding, editing, deleting, and viewing contact details. The frontend is built using **React.js** with **Tailwind CSS** for styling, while the backend is powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, connected to a **MongoDB** database for data persistence.

Key features of the app include:
- **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing contacts.
- **Sorting** functionality to sort contacts by different attributes (e.g., First Name, Last Name, etc.).
- **Pagination** for displaying contacts in a paginated manner.
- **Toast notifications** for success and error handling.
